These PoE / PoE2 loot filter custom sounds will give you the highest dopamine rush, when getting those sweet sweet currency drops!

DISCLAIMER: They are very loud! So change your Item Filter Alert Volume lower (~30%) first and increase it from there, to not get deafened by the sounds!

How to set it up:

1. After downloading the loot filter sounds, go to "C:\Users\Documents\My Games\Path of Exile" or "C:\Users\Documents\My Games\Path of Exile 2"
2. Insert the six .MP3 files into this folder - don't put in the entire .zip file and don't change the file names, otherwise the game won't recognize the sounds
3. On Neversinks filterblade.xyz, load your loot filter, or create a new filter
4. Go to your "Overview" and find the "Global Filter Style" option right under the strictness bar
5. In the window that pops up you can chose filter styles (colours), but you also get an option to use either "default sounds" or "custom sounds", chose latter
6. Now go to "Export to PoE", press "Save & Sync" and upload your loot filter - I recommend creating a new Sync-target and give it a name that let's you know that this filter is using custom sounds
7. Once you're in-Game go to the Options(O) > Game > Item Filter > choose your filter from the dropdown menu and click the refresh button

Check your chat box, it'll tell you whether the Filter loaded successfully, the name + the version of the filter and the time of the last update, which should coincide with the time you created the filter

Have fun with your new Tings and Shwings, I hope they'll bring you as much joy as they brought to me! ;D
